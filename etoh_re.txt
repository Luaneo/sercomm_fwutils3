struct decrypted_firmware_blob_hdr
{
	char device_info[128];
	char sha256_digest[32];
}

SHA256 digest calculation logic:
Update context in 16384-byte chunks until EOF is hit.
Compression level for gzipped firmware-block blob: 6 (found hackily using compress_ctl.py)
Modified gzip module for Python which produces the right header (modified _write_gzip_header) can be found at gzip_mod.py
There seems to be some junk data past the PKCS#7 padding in some of the images, but it shouldn't matter since the decrypted FW is ftruncate()'d down to the image length specified in the header, which is the raw length.
